        "ANS : **Python is a popular programming language because of its simplicity, versatility, and broad ecosystem. Here are some key features that make it a top choice for programmers**\n",
        "1. **Easy to Read and Write:**\n",
        "Python has a clear, readable syntax that resembles plain English, making it easier for beginners to learn and for experienced developers to write clean, understandable code.\n",
        "2.   **Dynamically Typed:**\n",
        "Python does not require explicit declaration of variable types. This allows for more flexibility and faster coding, though it can come at the cost of runtime errors if not used carefully.\n",
        "Interpreted Language:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Python is an interpreted language**\n",
        " meaning that code is executed\n",
        "line-by-line, making debugging and testing easier. You can quickly see results without needing to compile your code.\n",
        "4.**extensive standard libraray**\n",
        "Python comes with a vast standard library that includes modules for working with file I/O, system calls, networking, internet protocols, databases, and more. This minimizes the need to write code from scratch for common tasks.\n",
        "5.**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**\n",
        "Python is platform-independent, meaning that it can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux without the need for changes to the code.\n",
        "6.**Extensive Standard Library:**Python supports various programming paradigms,including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This flexibility allows developers to use the approach best suited for their project.\n",
        "7.**Large and Active Community:**\n",
        "Python has a large and active community that contributes to its ecosystem. This means a wealth of third-party libraries and frameworks (such as Django, Flask, NumPy, and Pandas) are available, which speeds up development in areas like web development, data science, machine learning, and automation.\n",
        "8.**Integration Capabilities:**\n",
        "Python can easily integrate with other programming languages like C, C++, and Java. It also has tools for web services, calling from and working with libraries written in these languages\n",
        "9.**Wide Use in Data Science and Machine Learning:**\n",
        "Python’s simplicity, along with libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn, make it a go-to language for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers.\n",
        "10.**Robust Frameworks for Web Development:**\n",
        "Frameworks like Django and Flask allow developers to build robust web applications quickly and efficiently, making Python popular in the web development domain as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "These features, combined with Python's simplicity, flexibility, and wide application across various fields, contribute to its status as one of the most popular programming languages today."

        "\n",
        "3. **Handling Exceptions**:\n",

        "ANS : In Python, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is met. Python provides two main types of loops: for loops and while loops. Additionally, Python offers control flow statements like break, continue, and pass to manage the behavior of loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. for Loop\n",
        "The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. It is typically used when you know how many times you want to execute a block of code.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. while Loop\n",
        "The while loop in Python continues to execute the code block as long as the specified condition evaluates to True. It is typically used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on the condition.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Control Flow Statements in Loops\n",
        "a. break\n",
        "The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.**\n"
